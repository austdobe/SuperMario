# Super Mario
#### 'Super Mario' was created to function and look like the classic game of Super Mario. It was built as a challenge for Mintbean Hackathon.

## How it works:

#### 1. Control Mario through the different levels. Collect as many of the coins and jump on as many enemys as possible to raise your score. Find the castle to get to the bonus round.

#### 2. If you are feeling adventurous, there are secret coin purses hidden in some of the blocks. Crash through to find out which ones.
